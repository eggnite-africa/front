            <p>
              In this first iteration<sup>*</sup>, it's a platform that enables
              African makers to share their creations with a community of
              like-minded people. It is very much so akin to ProductHunt but the
              resemblance stops at the faÃ§ade.

            <p>
              Fundamentally Eggnite is about fostering a community of African
              makers and giving them the tools they need to develop products
              that can make things around them a bit better (or at least, less
              shitty).

              In this first iteration, the focus is going to be on shining a
              light on what's currently being built.

              Probably, but we'd need to talk about it first. Simply let me
              know, either through the feedback bubble (bottom-right of your
              screen) or contact me through my socials (see:

            <p>
              It's built on NodeJS. For the frontend I'm using Nuxt.The backend
              is powered by Nest, GraphQL and postgres. And it's being hosted on
              Heroku.

              Eggnite is a one man op. It's built by
