            <br />
            I want you to know that I'm sincerely happy that you joined our
            community! It might not mean much to you, but to me, it means the
            world. <br />
            <br />
            I strongly believe that together we can build a resilient,
            supportive and diverse community where developers and entrepreneurs
            alike can share their products (whether that'd be an app, an
            open-source project or a website) with the larger community enabling
            them to further improve upon received feedback.<br />
            <br />
            I can't wait to see what you've got to offer. We're all here to
            support and learn from each other!<br />
            <br />
            Again, thanks for joining; and know that I'm always here so if you
            have anything you'd like to say, don't hesitate to let me know!<br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-weight-medium">Sincerely, Karim Daghari.</span>
